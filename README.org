* Aim
  The no defunct [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand][DataHand]] keyboard is a very interesting input device but with a
  few serious limitations the greatest of which is that it is no longer in
  production and there is no indication that production will ever resume.
  However, there is sufficient interest in this form of keyboard that the
  excellent [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41422.0][DodoHand]] project has been setup to create an open-source version of
  the DataHand using state of the art 3D-printing methods to create the
  opto/magnetic switches.  While this is very promising it relies on very high
  quality and expensive 3D-printing methods and cheap filament-based techniques
  are not suitable.

  The aim of this project is to create a DataHand equivalent from scratch using
  readily available switches and components and avoiding the need for
  3D-printing.  A benefit of using spring/contact switches over the
  optical/magnetic switches in the DataHand is that they have better tactile
  feel and are more consistent but arranging them close enough is tricky.

  Here is the first prototype for the right-hand unit:

* Choosing the Switches
*** Down-switches
    Low force Cherry MX, either the linear "red" or tactile "brown".  One switch
    is required for each finger and thumb.  Obtaining Cherry MX switches in the
    UK from The Keyboard Company:
    + 10x [[http://www.keyboardco.com/product/cherry-key-switch-module-brown-tactile.asp][Brown]]
    + 10x [[http://www.keyboardco.com/product/cherry-key-switch-module-red-soft-linear.asp][Red]]
***** Centre Keycaps
      Need keycaps with long stems, ideally with a spherical rather than
      cylindrical finger shape.  One possibility is row 3 of the Signature
      Plastics SA range but these do not seem to be available anymore.  Only the
      DCS and DSA are readily available but the DSA are two low, only row 5 of
      the DCS family are tall enough.  These shape of keycaps are readily
      available from many sources, in particular the Keyboard Company, from
      which the top row of the Filco keypad set are suitable.
***** Thumb keycaps
      One option is to use the double length DSA keycap from Signature Plastics:
      + Thumbs: 2x 4INHEAKS78  DSA Extra Blank Keys 2 Space Deep Dish-Black (NDY)
      but if the Filco keypad set are used for the finger keys the DCS "enter"
      keycap could be used.
*** Side-switches
    There is not enough space to use Cherry MX for the side switches and small
    tactile switches generally require too much force and do not have a good
    feel.  Having tried a Microwriter which uses Cherry micro-switches it is
    clear that these would be a very good choice if they will fit in the space
    available.  In the DecaKeyer I played with both Cherry and Panasonic
    micro-switches and found that the Panasonics to have a slightly better feel
    and are more readily available in the UK.  RS-Components stock a large range
    of Panasonic micro-switches, the AVT and AVL types being most suitable as
    the leaver is more robust and has less lateral play.  The "L" versions are
    longer-life (at least mechanical) but the actuation force on the plunger is
    1.47N compared with 0.98N for the standard "T" versions (lower force
    versions are also available, 0.49N and 0.25N).  The long-leaver [[http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/microswitches/6990511/?searchTerm=699-0511&relevancy-data=636F3D3126696E3D4931384E525353746F636B4E756D6265724D504E266C753D656E266D6D3D6D61746368616C6C26706D3D5E5C647B337D5B5C732D2F255C2E2C5D5C647B332C347D2426706F3D313426736E3D592673743D52535F53544F434B5F4E554D4245522677633D4E4F4E45267573743D3639392D3035313126][AVT323461]]
    has an actuation force of 0.25N whereas the long-life long-leaver [[http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/microswitches/6994664/?searchTerm=699-4664&relevancy-data=636F3D3126696E3D4931384E525353746F636B4E756D6265724D504E266C753D656E266D6D3D6D61746368616C6C26706D3D5E5C647B337D5B5C732D2F255C2E2C5D5C647B332C347D2426706F3D313426736E3D592673743D52535F53544F434B5F4E554D4245522677633D4E4F4E45267573743D3639392D3436363426][AVL3835613]]
    has an actuation force of 0.44N which is may be too high for finger switches
    but maybe good for thumb switches.

    The DB3 range of Cherry switches might be suitable alternative and are
    cheaper than the equivalent Panasonic.  Rapid Electronics stock the full
    range of DB3 micro-switches for £1.04:
    + Cherry DB3C-A1LD Microswitch, Long Lever, product code [[http://www.rapidonline.com/Electronic-Components/Cherry-DB3C-A1LD-Microswitch-SPDT-0-1A-250V-AC-Long-Lever-Solder-50-2582][50-2582]] £1.04
    However, after playing with these switches for a while it is clear that they
    do not feel as positive as the Panasonic switches, have a higher force than
    even the longer-life version and the leaver is too flexible.
* First Prototype
  Finger-cluster prototypes with the standard and long-lifetime Panasonic
  swtiches operate well and although the lower force standard switches feel
  better in some respects the long-lifetime switches require the same force as
  the Cherry MX down switch and this consistency feels good.  Also the click is
  even more positive on the long-lifetime switches so the first complete
  prototype has these switches to see if the force is acceptable for typing.

  The switches are mounted (glued) on to cross-shaped ABS plates glued to the
  heads of M6 bolts and bolted to the ABS base-plate to allow changes in height
  and orientation.  The hand-rest it hand-carved out of a piece of laminated EPE
  packing-foam which is quite easy to work with a modeling saw and coarse
  glasspaper and has a very nice warm comfortable feel.  It is so good that I am
  not planning to change the material in subsequent versions as this is easy to
  replace when it gets dirty and also washable and different shapes can easily
  be made for other hand shapes and sizes.
